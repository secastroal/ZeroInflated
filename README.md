# ZeroInflated
This repository stores the results of the analyses included in the supplementary material of the article titled "Does Functional Somatic Symptoms measurement differ across Sex and Age? Differential Item Functioning in Somatic Symptoms measured with the CIDI" ([Acevedo-Mesa et al., In Press](https://psyarxiv.com/ks7fu/)). 

Here, we used the zero inflated IRT model presented in Wall et al. ([2015](https://doi.org/10.1177/0146621615588184)) to analyze data of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). The analyses were performed in Mplus, hence the input and output files of the models are available. Two ZI-IRT models were fitted, using two (cidi.out) and three (cidi_c3.out) classes. Moreover, the analyses were repeated but excluding 4 items: cidi19.out and cidi19_c3.out. These analyses did not show major differences with the standard IRT analyses reported in the paper.

Additional analyses were performed to test for DIF with the reduced scale (19 items). DIF was tested for gender (cidi19_g.out) and for age (cidi19_a.out). These analyses were performed for completeness but they were not interpreted.

For confidentiality reasons, the data used for this study is not available.
